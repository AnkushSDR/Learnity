                    <p><h3>Theorem 1: Equal chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.</h3></p>
                    <p>
                      Proof : You are given two equal chords AB and CD of a circle with centre O. You want to prove that ∠AOB = ∠COD.<br><br>

                      In triangles AOB and COD,<br>
                      
                      OA = OC (Radii of a circle)<br>
                      
                      OB = OD (Radii of a circle)<br>
                      
                      AB = CD (Given)<br>
                      
                      Therefore, ΔAOB ≅ ΔCOD (SSS rule)<br>
                      
                      This gives ∠AOB = ∠COD (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)<br>
                      
                      <em>Remark: For convenience, the abbreviation CPCT will be used in place of 'Corresponding parts of congruent triangles', because we use this very frequently as you will see.</em><br><br>
                      
                      Now if two chords of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre, what can you say about the chords? Are they equal or not? Let us examine this by the following activity:<br>
                      
                      Take a tracing paper and trace a circle on it. Cut it along the circle to get a disc. At its centre O, draw an angle AOB where A, B are points on the circle. Make another angle POQ at the centre equal to ∠AOB. Cut the disc along AB and PQ (see Fig. 9.5). You will get two segments ACB and PRQ of the circle. If you put one on the other, what do you observe? They cover each other, i.e., they are congruent. So AB = PQ.<br>
                  </p>

                    <p><h3>Theorem 2: If the angles subtended by the chords of a circle at the centre are equal, then the chords are equal.</h3></p>
                    <p>The above theorem is the converse of Theorem 1. If you take ∠AOB = ∠COD, then ΔAOB ≅ ΔCOD (Why?)</p>

            <p>Activity: Draw a circle on a tracing paper. Let O be its centre. Draw a chord AB. Fold the paper along a line through O so that a portion of the chord falls on the other. Let the crease cut AB at the point M. Then, ∠OMA = ∠OMB = 90° or OM is perpendicular to AB. Does the point B coincide with A (see Fig.9.3)? Yes it will. So MA = MB.</p>

            <p><h3>Theorem 4: The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord.</h3></p>
            <p>Let us be clear what is assumed in Theorem 9.3 and what is proved. Given that the perpendicular from the centre of a circle to a chord is drawn and to prove that it bisects the chord. Thus in the converse, what the hypothesis is 'if a line from the centre bisects a chord of a circle' and what is to be proved is 'the line is perpendicular to the chord'. So the converse is: <b>The line drawn through the centre of a circle to bisect a chord is perpendicular to the chord.</b></p>
            <p>Let AB be a chord of a circle with centre O and O is joined to the mid-point M of AB. You have to prove that OM ⊥ AB. Join OA and OB (see Fig. 9.4). <br><br>
              In triangles OAM and OBM,<br>
              OA = OB<br>
              AM = BM<br>
              OM = OM<br>
              Therefore, ΔOAM ≡ ΔOBM<br>
              This gives ∠OMA = ∠OMB = 90°<br>

              <p>Let AB be a line and P be a point. Since there are infinite numbers of points on a line, if you join these points to P, you will get infinitely many line segments PL₁, PL₂, PM, PL₃, PL₄, etc. Which of these is the distance of AB from P? You may think a while and get the answer. Out of these line segments, the perpendicular from P to AB, namely PM in Fig. 9.8, will be the least. In Mathematics, we define this least length PM to be the distance of AB from P. So you may say that:</p>
                <img src="Images/Subject/circlesdg4.jpg">
              <p>Note that if the point lies on the line, the distance of the line from the point is zero. A circle can have infinitely many chords. You may observe by drawing chords of a circle that longer chord is nearer to the centre than the smaller chord. You may observe it by drawing several chords of a circle of different lengths and measuring their distances from the centre. What is the distance of the diameter, which is the longest chord from the centre? Since the centre lies on it, the distance is zero. Do think that there is some relationship between the length of chords and their distances from the centre? Let us see if this is so.</p>

              <p>Next, it will be seen whether the converse of this theorem is true or not. For this, draw a circle with centre O. From the centre O, draw two line segments OL and OM of equal length and lying inside the circle. Then draw chords PQ and RS of the circle perpendicular to OL and OM respectively. Measure the lengths of PQ and RS. Are these different? No, both are equal. Repeat the activity for more equal line segments and drawing the chords perpendicular to them. This verifies the converse of the Theorem 9.5 which is stated as follows:</p>

              <p><h3>Theorem 6: Chords equidistant from the centre of a circle are equal in length.</h3></p>
              <p><b>Example 1: </b>f two intersecting chords of a circle make equal angles with the diameter passing through their point of intersection, prove that the chords are equal.</p>
              <p>
                Given that AB and CD are two chords of a circle, with centre O intersecting at a point E. PQ is a diameter through E, such that ∠ AEQ = ∠ DEQ. You have to prove that AB = CD.<br>
                Draw perpendiculars OL and OM on chords AB and CD, respectively. Now, <br><br>
                ∠ LOE = 180° - 90° - ∠ LEO = 90° - ∠ LEO (Angle sum property of a triangle)<br>
                = 90° - ∠ AEQ = 90° - ∠ DEQ<br>
                = 90° - ∠ MEO = ∠ MOE<br><br>
                In triangles OLE and OME,<br>
                ∠ LEO = ∠ MEO (Why?)<br>
                ∠ LOE = ∠ MOE (Proved above)<br>
                EO = EO (Common)<br><br>
                Therefore, ∆ OLE ≅ ∆ OME (Why ?)<br>

            <p>You can verify this fact by cutting the arc, corresponding to the chord CD from the circle along CD and put it on the corresponding arc made by equal chord AB. You will find that the arc CD superimpose the arc AB completely (see Fig. 9.13). This shows that equal chords make congruent arcs and conversely congruent arcs make equal chords of a circle. You can state it as follows</p>
            <img src="Images/Subject/circlesdg8.jpg">
            <p><h3>Theorem 7: If two chords of a circle are equal, then their corresponding arcs are congruent and conversely, if two arcs are congruent, then their corresponding chords are equal.</h3></p>
            <p>Also the angle subtended by an arc at the centre is defined to be angle subtended by the corresponding chord at the centre in the sense that the minor arc subtends the angle and the major arc subtends the reflex angle. Therefore, in Fig 9.14, the angle subtended by the minor arc PQ at O is ∠POQ and the angle subtended by the major arc PQ at O is reflex angle POQ.</p>
            <p><em>Congruent arcs (or equal arcs) of a circle subtend equal angles at the centre.</em> <br> Therefore, the angle subtended by a chord of a circle at its centre is equal to the angle subtended by the corresponding (minor) arc at the centre. The following theorem gives the relationship between the angles subtended by an arc at the centre and at a point on the circle.</p>
            <img src="Images/Subject/circlesdg9.jpg">
            <p><h3>Theorem 8: The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is double the angle subtended by it at any point on the remaining part of the circle.</h3></p>
            <p><b>Proof: </b><br> Given an arc PQ of a circle subtending angles POQ at the centre O and PAQ at a point A on the remaining part of the circle. We need to prove that ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ.</p>
            <p>
              Consider the three different cases as given in Fig. 9.15. In (i), arc PQ is minor; in (ii), arc PQ is a semicircle and in (iii), arc PQ is major. Let us begin by joining AO and extending it to a point B.<br>
              In all the cases,<br><br>
              ∠ BOQ = ∠ OAQ + ∠ AQO<br><br>
              because an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior opposite angles.<br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Also in ∆ OAQ,<br>
                OA = OQ (Radii of a circle)<br>
                Therefore, ∠ OAQ = ∠ OQA (Theorem 8)<br>
                This gives ∠ BOQ = 2 ∠ OAQ (1)<br>
                Similarly, ∠ BOP = 2 ∠ OAP (2)<br>
                From (1) and (2), ∠ BOP + ∠ BOQ = 2(∠ OAP + ∠ OAQ)<br>
                This is the same as ∠ POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ (3)<br>
                For the case (iii), where PQ is the major arc, (3) is replaced by,<br>
                reflex angle POQ = 2 ∠ PAQ<br>
              </p>
              <p><h3>Theorem 9: Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.</h3></p>
              <p>
                Again let us discuss the case (ii) of Theorem 10.8 separately. Here ∠PAQ is an angle in the segment, which is a semicircle. Also, ∠ PAQ = 1/2 ∠ POQ = 1/2 x 180° = 90°.<br>
                If you take any other point C on the semicircle, again you get that,<br>
                ∠ PCQ = 90°<br>
                Therefore, you find another property of the circle as:<br>
                Angle in a semicircle is a right angle.<br>
              </p>
              <p><h3>Theorem 10: If a line segment joining two points subtends equal angles at two other points lying on the same side of the line containing the line segment, the four points lie on a circle (i.e. they are concyclic).</h3></p>
              <p>In Fig. 9.17, AB is a line segment, which subtends equal angles at two points C and D.<br><br>
                That is, ∠ ACB = ∠ ADB,<br>
                To show that the points A, B, C and D lie on a circle,<br>
                let us draw a circle through the points A, C and B.<br>
                Suppose it does not pass through the point D. Then it will intersect AD (or extended AD) at a point, say E (or E').<br><br>
                If points A, C, E and B lie on a circle,<br>
                ∠ ACB = ∠ AEB (Why?)<br>
                But it is given that ∠ ACB = ∠ ADB.<br>
                Therefore, ∠ AEB = ∠ ADB.<br>
                This is not possible unless E coincides with D. (Why?)<br>
                Similarly, E' should also coincide with D<br>

          <p>A quadrilateral ABCD is called cyclic if all the four vertices of it lie on a circle (see Fig 9.18). You will find a peculiar property in such quadrilaterals. Draw several cyclic quadrilaterals of different sides and name each of these as ABCD. (This can be done by drawing several circles of different radii and taking four points on each of them.)You find that ∠A + ∠C = 180° and ∠B + ∠D = 180°, neglecting the error in measurements.</p>
          <p><h3>Theorem 11: The sum of either pair of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral is 180º.</h3></p>

            Join OC, OD and BC.<br>
