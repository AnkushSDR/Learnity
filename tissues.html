                <p>In simple terms, tissue can be defined as a group of cells with similar shape and function are termed as tissues. They form a cellular organizational level, intermediate between the cells and organ system. Organs are then created by combining the functional groups of tissues.</p>
                <p>The study of tissue is known as histology and study of disease-related to tissue is known as histopathology. The standard tools for studying tissues is by embedding and sectioning using the paraffin block.</p>
                <p><h2>Types of Animal Tissues</h2></p>
                <p>Animal tissues are grouped into four types: <br> <ul type="disk"><li>Connective Tissue</li><li>Muscle Tissue</li><li>Nervous Tissue</li><li>Epithelial Tissue</li></ul></p>
                <p>The collection of tissues are joined in structural units to serve a standard function of organs. The primary purpose of these four types of tissue differs depending on the type of organism. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type also differs.</p>

                <p>They are the group of tissues made up of cells separated by non-living material, called as an extracellular matrix. This tissue provides shape to the different organs and maintains their positions. For example, blood, bone, tendon, adipose, ligament and areolar tissues. There are three types of connective tissue:</p>
                <p>
