                <p><h2>What are balanced forces?</h2></p>
                <p>Balanced forces occur when two or more forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. These forces cancel each other out, resulting in no change in the object's state of motion. Essentially, if an object is at rest, it stays at rest; if it's moving, it continues to move at the same speed and in the same direction.</p>
                <p><em>Example: A book lying on a table experiences a balanced force. The gravitational force pulling it downward is balanced by the normal force exerted by the table pushing it upward.</em></p>
                <p><h3>Effects of Balanced Forces</h3></p>
                <p>
                    Balanced forces result in no change in an object's state of motion. When forces acting on an object are balanced, they cancel each other out, leading to:<br><br>
                    No Movement: If the object is at rest, it remains at rest.<br>
                    <em>Example: A book on a table stays stationary because the downward force of gravity is balanced by the upward force of the table.</em><br>
                    Constant Velocity: If the object is moving, it continues to move at a constant velocity (speed and direction).<br>
                    <em>Example: A car cruising at a constant speed on a straight, level road where the driving force is balanced by friction and air resistance.</em><br>

                <p><h2>What are unbalanced forces?</h2></p>
                <p>Unbalanced forces occur when the forces acting on an object do not cancel each other out, resulting in a net force that causes a change in the object's state of motion. This means the object will accelerate in the direction of the net force.</p>
                <p><em>Example: If you push a chair, the force you apply is greater than the frictional force resisting the movement, resulting in unbalanced forces. This causes the chair to move in the direction of your push.</em></p>
                <p><h3>Effects of Unalanced Forces</h3></p>
                <p>
                    Unbalanced forces cause a change in the object's state of motion. When the net force acting on an object is not zero, it leads to:<br><br>
                    Acceleration: The object speeds up in the direction of the net force.<br>
                    <em>Example: A car accelerating when the driver steps on the gas pedal, creating a net forward force.</em><br>
                    Deceleration: The object slows down when a net force acts opposite to its motion.<br>
                    <em>Example: A car slowing down as the driver applies the brakes, generating a net backward force.</em><br>
                    Change in Direction: The object changes direction when a force acts at an angle to its direction of motion.<br>
                    <em>Example: A soccer ball changing direction when kicked from the side.</em><br>

    <div class="designs">3. Law of Conservation of Momentum

            <button onclick="toggleDropdown('B2')" class="openbutton" style="margin-left: .5%;">Important Points</button>

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="B1">
                <p><h2>Introduction of the Law of Conservation of Momentum</h2></p>
                <p>The Law of Conservation of Momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant, provided no external forces are acting on it. This principle is derived from Newton's laws of motion and plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of objects in motion.</p>
                <p><h3>Understanding Momentum</h3></p>
                <p>Momentum is a measure of the quantity of motion an object has and is calculated as the product of an object's mass and its velocity. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.</p>
                <p>
                    The formula for momentum (p) is:<br>
                    <em>p = mv</em>, where p is the momentum, m is the mass of the object and v is its velocity.<br>
                    <p>The total momentum of a closed system of objects (i.e., no external forces acting on it) remains constant. In other words, the momentum before an interaction is equal to the momentum after the interaction. Mathematically, for a system of two objects before and after collision:<br></p>
                    <p><em>m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = m₁v'₁ + m₂v'₂</em>, where m₁ and m₂ are the masses, v₁ and v₂ are the initil velocities, and v'₁ and v'₂ are the final velocities.<br></p>
                </p>
                <p><h3>Applications and Examples</h3></p>
                <p>
                    Collisions: In both elastic and inelastic collisions, the total momentum of the system is conserved.<br>
                    Elastic Collision: Both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. Example: Two billiard balls colliding.<br>
                    Inelastic Collision: Momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is not. Example: A car crash where the vehicles stick together.<br>
                    Rocket Propulsion: The conservation of momentum explains how rockets move. As the rocket expels gas downwards, the rocket itself moves upwards with an equal and opposite momentum.<br>
                    <em>Example: Spacecraft propulsion in a vacuum relies on expelling gas at high speed to propel the craft forward.</em><br>
                    Explosions: During an explosion, the total momentum of the system is conserved. The fragments fly off in different directions, but the overall momentum remains the same as it was before the explosion.<br>
                    <em>Example: A firework exploding in the sky.</em><br>
                </p>
                <p><h3>Practical Importance</h3></p>
                <p>
                    Engineering: Understanding momentum conservation helps in designing safer vehicles, predicting the outcomes of collisions, and developing effective braking systems.<br>
                    Sports: Analyzing momentum in sports can improve performance and strategy, such as in football, where the momentum of players and the ball is crucial.<br>
                    Space Exploration: Calculating the momentum of spacecraft ensures accurate navigation and control during missions.<br>
