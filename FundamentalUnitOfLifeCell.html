                <p>Living organisms on Earth come in various species with different structures, including archaebacteria, Chlamydomonas, fungi, plants, animals, birds, eubacteria, and amoeba. These organisms are made up of microscopic units called cells, which are the basic structural and functional units of life.</p>
                <p>All cells share key characteristics: they contain DNA for genetic inheritance, are surrounded by a plasma membrane, and use similar mechanisms for energy metabolism.</p>
                <p>Some organisms are <b>unicellular</b>, meaning they consist of a single cell capable of self-replication, such as yeast, bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. In contrast, <b>multicellular</b> organisms are more complex, with multiple types of specialized cells that work together to support the organism's function and lifespan.</p>

                <p>The first cell was discovered by English scientist <b>Robert Hooke</b> in 1665. While examining a thin slice of cork under a microscope, he observed that it resembled a honeycomb structure with small compartments. He referred to these compartments as "cells." This discovery was significant because it suggested that living organisms were made up of smaller, structured units. Hooke's findings were published in his book <i>Micrographia</i> in 1665.</p>

                <p>In 1674, Anton von Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch microscopist, made an improved microscrope and discovered the free living cells in pond water for the first time.

                <p>The cell theory, a cornerstone of biology, developed through contributions from key scientists:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jakob Matthias Schleiden (1838):</strong> Proposed that all plants consist of cells.</li>
                    <li><strong>Theodor Schwann (1839):</strong> Asserted that both animals and plants are made of cells, establishing the foundation of cell theory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rudolf Virchow (1855):</strong> Added that all cells arise from pre-existing cells.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><h2>Postulates of Cell Theory:</h2></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>All organisms are made of cells and their products</strong> (e.g., secretions).</li>
                    <li><strong>Cells are the structural and functional units of life,</strong> where all metabolic reactions occur.</li>
                    <li><strong>All cells originate from pre-existing cells</strong> through division; spontaneous generation does not occur.</li>
                    <li><strong>Every organism begins as a single cell.</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p><em>Exception:</em> Viruses do not conform to cell theory.</p>

                        <li>Living organisms are composed of cells, the basic structural and functional unit of life.</li>
                        <li>Cells share common properties: DNA, plasma membrane, and energy metabolism mechanisms.</li>
                        <li>Living organisms can be unicellular (composed of one singular cell) or multicellular (composed of various types of cells or a large number of cells).</li>
                        <li>Robert Hooke coined the term "cell" in 1665 through his observation from the cell of a cork.</li>
                        <li>The protoplasm is the part of a cell where all living substances are found.</li>
                        <li>The nucleus's role is to transfer hereditary information from the parent cell to the offspring during cell division.</li>
                        <li>The cell theory states that all organisms are composed of cells (unicellular or multicellular), all metabolic reactions occur within cells, all cells are created from pre-existing cells through cell-division, and every organism starts as a singular cell (viruses are an exception to this theory).</li>

                <p>Each living cell can perform basic functions characteristic of all living forms. In multicellular organisms, like humans, division of labor ensures different body parts perform specific functions. Similarly, within a single cell, cell organelles act as specialized components, each performing a specific function essential for the cell's operation.</p><br>
                <img src="CellDiagramLabelled.jpg" style="height:35vh;width:30vw">
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 102, 25, 0.932);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 30vw;margin-left: 1.5vw;">Plasma Membrane or Cell Membrane</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Structure & Functions: </b></li>The plasma membrane is the outermost covering of the cell, separating its contents from the external environment. It regulates the movement of substances, allowing some materials to enter or exit while restricting others. This selective control makes it a selectively permeable membrane.</p>
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 62, 25, 0.63);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 10vw;margin-left: 2.5vw;">Diffusion</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Functions: </b></li>Some substances such as carbon dioxide or oxygen move across the plasma membrane through the process of diffusion. This occurs through the spontaneous movement of substances from a region of high concentration to a region of lower concentration to achieve uniform concentration inside the cell. <br><br> A similar process is used the in cells in the case of substances like Co2, and oxygen since they accumulate high concentration within cells. And, in the cell's external environment, the concentration of CO2 is lower than that inside of the cell.</p><br>
                <img src="Diffusion.png" style="height:30vh;">
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 62, 25, 0.63);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 10vw;margin-left: 2.5vw;">Osmosis</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Functions: </b></li>The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis. The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water. Thus, osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration.</p>
                <p><li><b>Types of solutions: </b></li>If the surrounding medium has a higher water concentration than the cell, making the outside solution very dilute, the cell will gain water through osmosis. This is known as a hypotonic solution. In this situation, water molecules move across the cell membrane in both directions, but more water enters the cell than leaves it. As a result, the cell will likely swell up. <br><br> If the surrounding medium has the same water concentration as the cell, there is no net movement of water across the cell membrane. This is called an isotonic solution. While water moves in both directions, the amounts entering and leaving are equal, resulting in no overall change in the cell's size. <br><br> If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell, meaning that it is a very concentrated solution, the cell will lose water by osmosis. Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution. </p><br>
                <img src="Osmosis.jpg" style="height:30vh;">
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 102, 25, 0.932);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 15vw;margin-left: 1.5vw;">Cell Wall</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Structure: </b></li>Plant cells, in addition to the plasma membrane, have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall. The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane. The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose. Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants.</p>
                <p><li><b>Functions: </b></li>Cell walls permit the cells of plants, fungi and bacteria to withstand very dilute (hypotonic) external media without bursting. In such media the cells tend to take up water by osmosis. The cell swells, building up pressure against the cell wall. The wall exerts an equal pressure against the swollen cell. Because of their walls, such cells can withstand much greater changes in the surrounding medium than animal cells.</p>
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 102, 25, 0.932);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 15vw;margin-left: 1.5vw;">Nucleus</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Structure:</b></li> The nucleus has a double layered covering called nuclear membrane. The nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside, that is, to the cytoplasm. The nucleus contains chromosomes, which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide.</p>
                <p><li><b>Functions:</b></li> The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction, the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells. It also plays a crucial part, along with the environment, in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity, by directing the chemical activities of the cell. <br><br> Chromosomes contain information for inheritance of characters from parents to next generation in the form of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) molecules. Chromosomes are composed of DNA and protein. DNA molecules contain the information necessary for constructing and organising cells. Functional segments of DNA are called genes. In a cell which is not dividing, this DNA is present as part of chromatin material. Chromatin material is visible as entangled masses of thread-like structures. Whenever the cell is about to divide, the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes. </p><br>
                <img src="Nucleus.png" style="height: 25vh;">
                <p><h3 style="padding-left: .2vw;background-color: rgba(184, 102, 25, 0.932);border-radius: 20px;text-align: center;height: 3vh;width: 15vw;margin-left: 1.5vw;">Cytoplasm</h3></p>
                <p><li><b>Structure: </b></li>The cytoplasm is the fluid region within the cell membrane, containing specialized organelles that each perform specific functions. In prokaryotic cells, there are no defined nuclear regions or membrane-bound organelles, while eukaryotic cells have a nuclear membrane and various membrane-enclosed organelles. Membranes are crucial for defining cellular structures and functions. Viruses, which lack membranes, do not exhibit characteristics of life until they invade a living host to replicate using the host's cellular machinery.</p>
                <p><li><b>Functions: </b></li>The cytoplasm provides a fluid medium where biochemical reactions occur, supporting cellular metabolism. It helps maintain the cell's shape and provides structural support by filling the space between the cell membrane and the nucleus. The cytoplasm stores various substances, including nutrients, ions, and waste products, which the cell can use or dispose of as needed. Cytoplasm facilitates the movement of materials within the cell, allowing organelles to communicate and share resources efficiently.</p>

                <p>Cell division is the biological process by which a parent cell divides into daughter cells. It is fundamental to the growth, development, and reproduction of all living organisms. Cell division serves various purposes such as increasing the number of cells for growth, repairing damaged tissues, and producing gametes for reproduction.</p>

                <p>Mitosis occurs in somatic (body) cells and results in two identical daughter cells. The process ensures that each daughter cell receives an exact copy of the parent cell’s genetic material, maintaining the same chromosome number. The purpose of this is to ensure the asexual reproduction, growth and repair in organisms.</p>

                <p>Meiosis occurs in reproductive cells (gametes) and results in four non-identical daughter cells. It reduces the chromosome number by half, ensuring genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms. There are two processes for Meiosis, that are <b>Meiosis I</b>, where the homologous chromosomes sperate and multiply. And, <b>Meiosis II</b> is the process in which the sister chromatids seperate, producing haploid cells. The purpose of this is to ensure the formation of gametes and maintaining the stability of chromosome numbers.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cell division is the process where a parent cell divides to produce daughter cells, essential for growth, repair, and reproduction. There are two main types of cell division:</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mitosis: Occurs in somatic (body) cells, resulting in two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number as the parent cell. It is crucial for asexual reproduction, growth, and tissue repair.</li>

                            <li>Meiosis: Occurs in reproductive cells (gametes) and results in four non-identical daughter cells with half the chromosome number. Meiosis includes two stages: Meiosis I, where homologous chromosomes separate, and Meiosis II, where sister chromatids separate. This process ensures genetic diversity and the formation of gametes.</li>
