                <em>A group of two or more atoms is linked together by sharing electrons in a chemical bond.</em>
                <p>A molecule is a collection of two or more atoms that are securely bound together by attractive forces or by chemical bonds. The term “atom” refers to the tiniest unit of matter that can be separated. The term “valency” refers to an element's capacity for combination.</p>
                <p>Atoms are much too small to be seen; hence experiments to find out their structure and behavior have to be conducted with large numbers of them. From the results of these experiments, we may attempt to construct a hypothetical model of an atom that behaves like the true atom.</p>
                <p>Molecules consist of one or more atoms bound together by covalent (chemical) bonds. Atoms may be depicted by circle shapes, each of which has a nucleus at the center (containing protons and neutrons), surrounded by one or more concentric circles representing the 'shells' or 'levels' in which the electrons surrounding the nucleus of the atom are located and markings indicating the electron.at each level. A molecule is the smallest thing a substance can be divided into while remaining the same substance. It is made up of two or more atoms that are bound together by chemical bonding.</p>
                <img src="Images\Subject\atomsmoleculespic1.jpg">
                <p>The smallest particle of an element, which may or may not have an independent existence but always takes place in a chemical reaction is called an atom. An atom is defined as the smallest unit that retains the properties of an element. An atom is composed of sub-atomic particles and these cannot be made or destroyed. All atoms of the same element are identical and different elements have different types of atoms. Chemical reactions occur when atoms are rearranged.</p>
                <p>Atoms consist of three fundamental types of particles, protons, electrons and neutrons. Neutrons and protons have approximately the same mass and in contrast to this the mass of an electron is negligible. A proton carries a positive charge, a neutron has no charge and an electron is negatively charged. An atom contains equal numbers of protons and electrons and therefore overall an atom has no charge. The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons only, and therefore is positively charged. The electrons occupy the region of space around the nucleus. Therefore, most of the mass is concentrated within the nucleus.</p>
                <p>The center of the atom is called the nucleus. The nucleus contains neutrons and protons that give an atom its weight and positive charges. A neutron carries no charge and has a mass of one unit. A proton carries a single positive charge and also has a mass of one unit, The atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons or positive charges in the nucleus. The atomic weight of an element is determined by combining the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. An electron carries a single negative charge. If an atom of an element is to have zero charge, it must have the same number of electrons as protons. These electrons are arranged in orbits around the nucleus of the atom like the layers of an anion.</p>

                        <li>A molecule is made up of two or more atoms that are chemically bound together by attractive forces or chemical bonds. Atoms are the smallest units of matter, capable of being separated but retaining the properties of the element. The valency of an element refers to its ability to combine with other elements.</li>
                        <li>Atoms are too small to be seen, so experiments involving large numbers of atoms are necessary to understand their structure. A model of the atom can be constructed from these experiments. Atoms are depicted as having a nucleus, containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by concentric shells representing the orbits of electrons.</li>
                        <li>Atoms are composed of three subatomic particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. Protons and neutrons have similar mass, while electrons have negligible mass. A proton carries a positive charge, a neutron has no charge, and an electron carries a negative charge. The number of protons in an atom determines its atomic number, while the combined number of protons and neutrons determines its atomic weight.</li>
                        <li>In a neutral atom, the number of protons equals the number of electrons, balancing the positive and negative charges. The protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus, while electrons orbit the nucleus in layers or shells. The nucleus is positively charged due to the protons, and most of the atom's mass is concentrated in the nucleus.</li>

                <p>The size of an atom is extremely small, much smaller than our imagination. A layer of an atom as thick as a thin sheet of paper is formed when more than millions of atoms are stacked together. It is impossible to measure the size of an isolated atom because it’s difficult to locate the positions of electrons surrounding the nucleus.</p>
                <p>However, the size of an atom can be estimated by assuming that the distance between adjacent atoms is equal to half the radius of an atom. Atomic radius is generally measured in nanometres.</p>

                <p><em>A molecule is defined as the smallest unit of a compound that contains the chemical properties of the compound.</em></p>
                <p>Molecules are made up of groups of atoms. Describing the structure of an atom, an atom is also sub-divided into smaller units. Protons, electrons, and neutrons are sub-particles of an atom. The protons and neutrons are contained inside the nucleus of the atom and electrons revolve around the nucleus.</p>
                <p>Protons are positively charged particles whereas electrons are negatively charged particles. Neutrons do not carry any charge. So we can say that the nucleus is positively charged due to the presence of protons. The nucleus is a bulk mass at the centre of an atom. Atoms are largely vacant.</p>
                <p>Every element has a certain atomic number. The atomic number of an element is defined as the number of protons present in its nucleus. It is denoted by Z.</p>
                <p>When we talk about the mass of atoms, the mass of their particles is taken into consideration. Electrons have negligible mass. Hence the mass of an atom is the sum of the mass of protons and neutrons. The mass number is denoted by A.</p>
                <p>A molecule is the smallest unit (particle) of a compound having the physical and chemical properties of that compound. This does not mean that molecules can not be broken down into smaller parts, e.g. the atoms from which they are formed or the fragments of the molecule, each consisting of several atoms or parts of atoms.</p>

                <p>The simplest forces between atoms are those which arise as a result of electron transfer. A simple example is that of say sodium fluoride. The sodium atom has a nuclear charge of +11, with 2 electrons in the K shell, 8 in the L shell and 1 in the M shell. The fluorine atom has a nuclear charge of 9 with 2 electrons in the K shell and 7 in the L shell.</p>
                <p>The outermost electron in the sodium atom may transfer readily to the fluorine atom; both atoms then have a complete shell but the sodium now has a net charge of +1 and the fluorine a net charge of -1. These ions, therefore, attract one another by direct coulombic interaction. The force between them is strong it varies as x-2, where x is the distance between the ions, and it acts in the direction of the line joining the ions.</p>
