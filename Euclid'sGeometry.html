                    The word 'geometry' comes from the Greek words 'geo' meaning the 'earth' and 'metrein' meaning 'to measure'. Geometry appears to have originated from the need for measuring lands. This branch of mathematics was studied in various forms in ancient civilizations. The geometry of the Vedic Period (800 BC to 500 BC) originated with the construction of altars (or Vedis) for performing Vedic rites. Square and circular altars were used for household rituals while altars having shapes as combinations of rectangles, triangles and trapeziums were used for public its ordinate is rituals (worship). The Sriyantra consists of nine interwoven isosceles triangles. The Greeks developed geometry in a very systematic manner. <br>
                    Three Greek mathematicians, namely, Thales (600 BC), Pythagoras (Thales Pupil, 572 BC) and Euclid (300 BC) contributed a lot on geometry. Thales proved that a circle is bisected by its diameter. Pythagoras developed the theory of geometry to a great extent. Euclid introduced the method of proving mathematical results by using deductive logical reasoning and the previously proved results. <br>
                    The geometry of plane figures is known as Euclidean geometry. His famous book 'Elements', divided into thirteen chapters, contains wonderful results on geometry. In Indus Valley Civilization, the size of bricks was taken as (4 x 2 x 1) inches. Three Indian mathematicians Aryabhata (born AD 476), Brahmagupta (born AD 598) and Bhaskara II (born AD 1114) are the main contributors in geometry. Aryabhata worked out the area of an isosceles triangle, the volume of a pyramid and approximate value of Ï€. <br>
                    Brahmagupta discovered the formula for finding the area of a cyclic quadrilateral. Bhaskara II gave a dissection proof of Pythagoras' theorem.

                <p>Self-evident true statements used throughout mathematics and not specifically linked to geometry are called <i>axioms</i> while those specific to geometry are known as <i>postulates</i>. However, nowadays we do not distinguish between axioms and postulates.</p>
                <p><h2>Euclid's Axioms</h2></p>
                <p>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li>Things which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.</li>
                        <li>If equals are added to equals, the wholes are equal.</li>
                        <li>If equals are subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.</li>
                        <li>Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.</li>
                        <li>The whole is greater than the part.</li>
                        <li>Things which are double of the same thing are equal to one another.</li>

                </p>
                <p><h2>Euclid's Five Postulates</h2></p>
                <p><em><b>Postulate 1: </b>A straight line may be drawn from any one point to any other point.</em> Euclid assumed that there is a unique line joining two distinct points.</p><br>
                <img src="Images/Subject/EGP1.png">
                <p><em><b>Postulate 2: </b>A terminated line can be produced indefinitely.</em> In present-day term, we say that a line segment can be extended on either side to form a line.</p>
                <p><em><b>Postulate 3: </b>A circle can be drawn with any centre and any radius.</em></p>
                <p><em><b>Postulate 4: </b>All right angles are equal to one another.</em></p>
                <p><em><b>Postulate 5: (Playfair's axiom) </b>If a straight line falling on two straight line makes the interior angles on the same side of it taken together less than two right angles, then the two straight lines, if provided indefinitely, meet on that side on which the sum of the angles is less than two right angles.</em></p>
                <p>In the given figure, the line AB falls on two straight lines CD and EF cutting them at the points G and H such that angle CGH + angle EHG < 180 degrees on the left side of AB. <br><br> So, the straight lines CD and EF when produced on the left-hand side will meet at a point. Later on, the fifth postulate was modified as <br> <em>"For every line L and for every point P not lying on L, there exists a unique line M passing through P and parallel to L."</em></p><br>

                <p><em><b>Half-Line: </b>Let A, B and C be any three points on a given line l such that A lie between B and C and we delete the point A. Then, each of the two remaining parts, namely AB and AC are called half-lines.</em></p>
