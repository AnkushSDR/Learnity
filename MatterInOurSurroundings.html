                    <p><h2>What are Mixtures?</h2></p>
                    <p>A mixture in chemistry is a substance made up of two or more unrelated chemical components. A mixture is a physical combination of two or more distinct substances that can take the form of solutions, suspensions, or colloids.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Crude oil: A mixture of organic compounds (mainly hydrocarbons)</li>
                            <li>Seawater: A mixture of various salt and water.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Mixtures</b> are formed by two or more pure substances (components) such that each substance remains its own chemical identity.</p>
                    <p><h2>Types of Mixtures:</h2></p>
                    <p>Heterogeneous and homogeneous mixtures are the two types of mixtures. While homogeneous mixtures seem consistent throughout, heterogeneous mixtures have clearly discernible components. A solution, which can be a consistent throughout, heterogeneous mixtures have clearly discernible components. A solution, which can be a solid, liquid, or gas, is the most typical kind of homogenous mixture.</p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Homogeneous Mixtures:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A mixture which has a uniform composition throughout is called a homogeneous mixture or solution.</li>
                                    <li>Examples: sugar in water, salt in water.</li>

                <p><h2>What are Physical and Chemical Changes?</h2></p>
                <p>The nature of the substance, the particles that make up it, and the quantity of particles all stay unaltered after a physical change. Chemical changes result in new compounds with different properties from the original ones, as well as new particles and maybe altered particle numbers.</p>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A substance is said to undergo a physical change when only the physical properties such as the shape, size, colour, or state of the substance change. No new substance is formed.</li>
                        <li>Example: melting of ice, boiling water.</li>
                        <li>A substance is said to undergo a chemical change when a new substance with completely new properties (physical and chemical) is formed.</li>
                        <li>Example: Burning of wood or paper, souring of milk.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p><h2>Solutions And Their Properties</h2></p>
                <p>Anything dissolved in a solution is referred to as a solute. In a fluid solution, the amount of solvent always outweighs the amount of solute. Two of the most prevalent solutes in our daily lives are salt and water. Salt is the solute because it dissolves in water. Examples of solute include Sugar, dissolved carbon dioxide, Oxygen, water vapour, carbon dioxide, argon.</p>
                <p>Solvent refers to the component of a solution that is most prevalent. It is the fluid in which the solute has been dissolved. Typically, a solvent is a liquid. Examples of the solvent include Water, Ethanol, Methanol, Acetone, tetrachloroethylene, Toluene, Methyl acetate.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Its particles are too tiny and have a diameter less than 1 nm.</li>
                    <li>The particles are not visible to naked eyes.</li>
                    <li>Particles do not scatter a beam of light passing through it and hence do not show the Tyndall effect.</li>
                    <li>The solute particles never settle down on keeping undisturbed.</li>
                    <li>The components of a solution cannot be separated using filtration.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><h3>Alloys</h3></p>
                <p>Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of metals or a mixture of a metal and another element that cannot be separated into their components by physical methods. Example: Steel, a combination of iron and carbon. Bronze, a combination of copper and tin. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc.</p>

                <p><h2>What is a concentrated solution?</h2></p>
                <p>The amount of solute that has dissolved in a specific amount of solvent or solution is measured as solution concentration. A concentrated solution is one that has a significant amount of dissolved solute in it. A diluted solution is one that has a small amount of dissolved solute in it.</p>
                <p><h3>Solubility</h3></p>
                <p>Unsaturated solutions, on the other hand, are those that contain less solute than the maximum that can be dissolved. A saturated solution is one that contains the maximum quantity of solute that can be dissolved. The amount of a solute that dissolves in a solvent is known as its solubility. The majority of solutes become more soluble when the solvent's temperature rises.</p>
                <p>
                    ● Solubility is the property showing the ability of a given substance, which is the solute, to dissolve in a solvent.<br>
                    ● It is measured in terms of the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a solvent at equilibrium.<br>
                    ● The resulting solution is called a saturated solution.<br>
                    ● Factors Affecting Solubility:<br>
                    ● Temperature - Solubility increases with temperature. The situation is different for gases. With the increase in temperature, they became less soluble in each other and in water, but more soluble in organic solvents.<br>
                    ● Pressure - For the majority of solid and liquid solutes, pressure does not affect solubility. The solubility of gas is directly proportional to the pressure of this gas.
            </p>
          <p><h3>Types of solutions based on concentration of the solution</h3></p>
            <p>There are 2 main types of solutions based on the definition. Dilute Solution is a solution that contains a little amount of solute. Concentrated Solution is a solution that contains a lot of solute.  There are three types of solutions based on the concentration of solutions, they are; Dilute, Concentrated amd Saturated Solution.</p>
            <p><h3>Representing the concentration of a solution</h3></p>
            <p>
                (i) Mass by the mass percentage of a solution = (Mass of solute / Mass of solution) x 100<br><br>
                (ii) Mass by volume percentage of a solution = (Mass of solute/ volume of solution) x 100<br><br>
                <em>For example, if a solution of NaCl in water is said to be 10% by volume that means a 100 ml solution will  contain 10 ml NaCl.</em>

            <div class="dropdown-content" id="C1">
                <p><h3>What is a suspension?</h3></p>
                <p>A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture in which the solute particles do not dissolve but remain suspended throughout the bulk of the medium.</p>
                <p><h3>Charactertistics of Suspensions</h3></p>
                <p>
                    <li>The solute particles settle down when a suspension is left undisturbed.</li>
                    <li>They can be separated from the mixture by filtration.</li>
                    <li> A suspension is a heterogeneous mixture</li>
                    <li>The size of solute particles in a suspension is quite large. It is larger than 100 mm in diameter.</li>
                    <li>The particles of a suspension can be seen easily.</li>
                    <li>The particles of a suspension do not pass through a filter paper. So a suspension can be separated by filtration.</li>
                </p>
                <p><h3>What is a colloid?</h3></p>
                <p>All types of mixtures can be defined as "colloids" based on their particle size; Solution, Suspension and Colloidal solutions.</p>
                <p>A colloidal solution is a mixture in which the substances are regularly suspended in a fluid. Properties of colloids and their variation are a well-known area ever since primitive age. Colloidal solutions are classified into; Foam, Emulsion and Sol.</p>
                <p><h3>Tyndall Effect</h3></p>
                <p>Tyndall effect is the scattering of light by particles in a colloid or else particles in a very fine suspension. E.g, it can be observed when sunlight passes though the canopy of a dense forest. </p>
                <img src="Images/Subject/tyndalleffect.png">
                <p>
                    <li>Dispersed phase: The solute-like component of the dispersed particles in a colloidal form is called the dispersed phase.</li>
                    <li>Dispersion medium: The component in which the dispersed phase is suspended is known as the dispersing medium.</li>
                    <li>Aerosol: A colloidal solution with dispersed phase solid/liquid and dispersing medium gas is called Aerosol. e.g., clouds.</li>
                    <li>Foam: A colloidal solution with a dispersed phase of a gas and a dispersing medium of a solid/liquid is called Form. e.g., Shaving cream.</li>
                    <li>Sols: A colloidal solution with dispersed phase solid and dispersing medium liquid is called Sol. e.g. Milk of magnesia</li>
                    <li>Gel: A colloidal solution with dispersed phase liquid and dispersing medium solid is called Gel.</li>
                    <li>Emulsion: A colloidal solution with dispersed phase liquid and dispersing medium liquid is called Emulsion.</li>

                <p><h3>Seperation of the components of a mixture</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heterogeneous mixtures are separated into their constituents by simple physical methods.</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 2vw;">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Methods of physical seperation include: handpicking, sieving and filtration.</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><h3>Handpicking</h3></p>
                <p>Handpicking is a manual method of separating large-sized impurities from a mixture. This method is commonly used when the components of the mixture are easily distinguishable by size, shape, or color. For example, you might use handpicking to remove stones from grains or to separate different types of beans.</p>
                <img src="Images/Subject/handpicking.png">
                <p><h3>Sieving</h3></p>
                <p>Sieving is a method used to separate particles of different sizes. A sieve, which is a mesh or net with holes of a specific size, is used to allow smaller particles to pass through while retaining larger particles. This method is often used in kitchens to sift flour or in construction to separate sand from gravel.</p>
                <img src="Images/Subject/sieving.jpeg">
                <p><h3>Seperation of two Immiscible Liquids</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Separation of a mixture of two immiscible liquids is done by using a separating funnel.
                    </li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 2vw;">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Applications: To separate a mixture of oil and water, in the extraction of iron from its ore.</li>
                        </ul>  
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Immiscible liquids break out into layers according to their densities, which is the basic idea behind the separation of immiscible liquids using a separating funnel.</p>
                <p><h3>Centrifugation</h3></p>
                <p>Centrifugation uses centrifugal force for the separation of two liquids in a mixture. Here, a denser component of the mixture migrates away from the axis, and lighter component migrates owards the axis</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Used for blood and urine tests in diagnostic facilities.</li>
                        <li>Used to separate butter from cream in dairies and at home.</li>
                        <li>Utilised in washing machines to extract water from drenched clothing.</li>
